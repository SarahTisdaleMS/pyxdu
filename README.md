Name
----

pyxdu â€” display the output of "du" in a window


Synopsis
--------

```
pyxdu [options] <file>
pyxdu [options] [-]
pyxdu --help
```


Description
-----------

_Pyxdu_ is a program for displaying a graphical tree of disk space utilization as
reported by the UNIX utility "du". The user can navigate through the tree structure and
change the order of the displayed information. The window is divided up into several
columns, each of which is one level deeper in the directory hierarchy (from left to
right). Boxes are drawn for each directory. The amount of vertical space occupied by
each box is directly proportional to the amount of disk space consumed by it and all of
its children. The name of each directory and the amount of data are displayed provided
that there is enough space within its box. Any space at the "bottom" of a box not
covered by its children to the right represents the space consumed by files _in_ that
directory (as opposed to space from its children).

There are several command line options available.

* `-h --help`
    * Show help message.
* `-n`
    * Sort in numerical order.
* `--dump <file>`
    * Dump tree as JSON for debugging.
* ...


Mouse Actions
-------------

The user can move up or down the tree by clicking the left mouse on a directory box. If
the left most box is selected, the display will move up one level (assuming you are not
already at the root). If any other box is selected, it will be placed against the left
edge of the window, and the display will be rescaled appropriately. ~~At any time the
middle mouse will bring you back to the root. Clicking the right mouse will exit the
program.~~
